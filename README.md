# COMPAS Detection Likelihood computer
Utils to run the COMPAS cosmic-integration code in large batches and compute the LnL.

Given metallicity and star formation params, and a detection rate matrix this helps 
- run COMPAS's `cosmic-integrator` code
- saves the detection rate matricies given the params
- computes the LnL (and uncertainty)
